### Project: CoordiMate

CoordiMate is a **desktop app for event planners**. It helps you **manage your contacts and tasks** for your events, so that you can focus on the event itself.

CoordiMate is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, CoordiMate can help you get your contact management tasks done **faster than traditional GUI apps**.

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
